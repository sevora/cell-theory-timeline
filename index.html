                    <h1>Hooke, Robert</h1>
                    Robert Hooke discovered a structure in a cork of a wine bottle with his own improvised microscope.
                    His microscope had originally been constructed by Christopher White.
                    <br><br>
                    Robert is a polymath, a man of many sciences, and due to his achievements, he has been dubbed as 
                    <i>England's Leonardo</i>

                    <h1>Beginning of Cell Theory</h1>
                    What he had seen was something quite new to the human eye at that time.
                    He called it a "cell" as, for him, it resembled cells in a monastery.
                    <br></br>
                    With his interest piqued, he continued looking at countless organisms and drew the beauty of the 
                    smaller world into his book <i>Micrographia</i>
                    <br></br>
                    Inside the book were drawings of a variety of insects such as a flea, louse, gnat, dronefly, and blue fly. 
                    Other than that, it also contained notes about planetary bodies, and wave theory of light.

                    <h1>The Father</h1>
                    Antonnie van Leuwenhook was a draper, in common words, he sells clothes. However, his current tool to analyze
                    the quality of fabrics was unsatisfactory for him. As a retaliation, he made his own glass.
                    <br><br>
                    Unbeknowst to him, he just made a powerful microscope, able to magnify up to 270 times into the subject. He started 
                    drawing insects in that detail and as he was curious, he sent it to the <i>Royal Society.</i> 
                    <br></br>He then tried looking at pond water, and surpsisingly, there were seemingly living organisms in it that cannot be seen
                    by the naked eye. This disproved the <i>spontaneous generation fallacy</i>, and moved the science of microbiology to greater heights.

                    <h1>Schleiden, Matthias</h1>
                    Matthias Schleiden, a German botanist who had a great deal of interest for his hobby. A co-founder
                    of the modern cell theory.

                    <br></br>
                    He proposed that all plants are composed of cells and that cells are the building blocks of all plants.

                    <br></br>
                    He studied law but botany seemed to pique his interest more and pursued it instead. So as a professor of botany,
                    he wrote his <i>Contributions to Phytogenesis</i>

                <div class="right-half">
                    <h2>Contributions to Phytogenesis</h2>
                    Inside his work, it states that all plants must be made of cells or a derivative of cells as from
                    what he have observed from the microscope.
                    <br></br>At that time, it was an informal belief. He also realized that the nucleus of a cell has a purpose related to
                    how cell division works.
                    <br></br>
                    Schleiden strongly believed in the <i>Theory of Evolution</i> by Charles Darwin as it could explain the diversity of plants.
                    Thus, making him known to be one of the earliest advocate of Darwinism in Germany.

                    <br><br>
                    "All living things are composed of cells and cell products." This lead to the conclusion that cells are the fundamental unit
                    of every living thing.

                    <br><br>
                    During a meeting with Schwann, they talked about cells of plants and animals. The two shared what they have observed and came to a conclusion which led to a more
                    refined cell theory. He then published his long-titled book that could be translated as "microscopic investigation of plants and animals" 
                    and this work became a foundation to the modern biology.

                    cellular pathology. 
                    <br><br>The newfound knowledge meant that diseases arose, not in the tissues or the organs themselves, but rather from their
                    individual cells.
                    <br><br>However there is some controversy about his contribution to the cell theory. It is now known that Robert Remak, his former colleague, had published
                    the same idea 3 years before Virchow did. Well this is plagiarism, but due to the standards of the old times coupled with Virchow's strong reputation and that 
                    Remak is a Jew in an anti-semetic nation, Virchow got away with it.

                    observation that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This observation is related to a previous belief that news cells are created

                    Hi, I'm Ralph Louis Gopez. I made this website.
                    If you see this on the internet and actually use it then all I can say is,
                    <h2>You're welcome</h2>
                    <h2><a href="https://twitter.com/ralphlouisgopez">Follow me on Twitter</a></h2>
                    <h2><a href="https://github.com/sevora">Follow me on Github</a></h2>
                    Note: Yes, I am a fan of anime so much you might as well call me a <i>weeb</i>, I also like Hololive
                    and I always steer clear from the forever-cliched Hollywood movies, series, and dramas.

                    <h1>Gopez, Ralph</h1>
                    The creator of this website. He is weird in the sense that he can actually look like that jock school bully,
                    and yet acts like a nerd.

                    <br><br>As a child, he had a feeling that a perfect world, a ridiculously perfect world that one 
                    may call it a utopia, can be achieved. However, as he grew, a lot of experiences opened his eyes to the cruel reality.

                    <br><br>Yet here he is, up and alive, working towards what he envisioned. "Only death can stop me," he says with a confident smile.
